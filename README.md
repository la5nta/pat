## Overview

Pat is a cross platform Winlink client with basic messaging capabilities.

It is the primary sandbox/prototype application for the [wl2k-go](https://github.com/la5nta/wl2k-go) project, and provides both a command line interface and a responsive (mobile-friendly) web interface.

It is mainly developed for Linux, but are also known to run on OS X, Windows and Android.

#### Features
* Message composer/reader (basic mailbox functionality).
* Auto-shrink image attachments.
* Post position reports with location from local GPS, browser location or manual entry.
* Rig control (using hamlib) for winmor PTT and QSY.
* CRON-like syntax for execution of scheduled commands (e.g. QSY or connect).
* Built in http-server with web interface (mobile friendly).
* Git style command line interface.
* Listen for P2P connections using multiple modes concurrently.
* AX.25, telnet, WINMOR and ARDOP support.
* Experimental gzip message compression (See "Gzip experiment" below).

### Gzip experiment

Gzip message compression has been added as an experimental B2F extension. The extension is implemented as a backwards compatible alternative to the ancient LZHUF compression.

This experiment is enabled by default and sessions between two Pat nodes (or other software supporting this B2F extension) will use gzip compression when transferring messages.

For more information, see <https://github.com/la5nta/wl2k-go#gzip-experiment>.
