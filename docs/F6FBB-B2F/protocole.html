<ul class="txt">
  <li>The Ascii protocol in FBB software implements two forward protocols. The first one is
    the standard MBL/RLI protocol. The second one was developed for greater efficiency,
    particularly on long links where the command propagation delays occupy a significant
    portion of time. The exchange of commands and data is reduced to a minimum by sending
    several requests at a time. In normal VHF use up to five requests or messages are sent in
    one block. The data transfer direction is reversed after every block of data, This
    minimises the delaying effect of long links through Nodes and digipeaters, and also saves
    some time over short links (eg HF...). <br>
  </li>
  <li>FBB protocol is very simple in operation. It is based on MID/BID message identification.
    The protocol availability is indicated by the F letter in the SID (system type identifier
    contained in square brackets). All protocol command lines start in first column with the
    'F' character. All protocol command lines are terminated by a return (CR) character. <br>
  </li>
  <li>This is the specification of the basic Ascii protocol. When I connect to another BBS
    that is FBB protocol capable, I will receive the SID followed by some text and the prompt
    (&quot;&gt;&quot;). The SID must contain the F flag, I send immediately my SID and the
    first proposal. <br clear="both">
  </li>
  <li>Proposals looks like : </li>

    missing upon receipt, an error message will be sent immediately followed by a
    disconnection. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Messages are sent in blocks. There can be up to five FB command proposals per block. The
    number of command proposals are determined by the maximum size of a block of messages. In
    FBB software there is a parameter in INIT.SRV file which defines the maximum size of the
    message block. It is set by default to 10KB for VHF use. It can be adjusted according to
    the quality of the link. <br clear="both">

  <li>The actual message content is transfered in a different format from the Ascii protocol.
    The transfer is done in binary mode. The format used is derived from the YAPP protocol
    which is very reliable. Each message is made up of a header, blocks of data, an end of
    message marker and a checksum. This is directly equivalent to the transfer of one message
    in the Ascii protocol. Unlike YAPP transfers, there is no individual packet
    acknowledgement during the transmission of messages, the protocol is thus simpler and more
    efficient. <br>
