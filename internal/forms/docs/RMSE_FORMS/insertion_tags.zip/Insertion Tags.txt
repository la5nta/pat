Message Templates

When composing a message, Winlink Express allows users to apply templates to pre-populate selected fields within the message,  Fields in the template can be used to select the message type (Winlink or Peer-to-Peer) and can be populates the To:, CC:, Subject, and Message boxes on the form.  Within the fields, several insertion tags are supported which will be updated with applicable content when the template is applied  Tags can be embedded anywhere in the form fields.

--- Template Commands  ---

Here is a list of available commands in the template.  These lines must appear before the "Msg:" line that starts the body of the message.  All of these commands are terminated by the end of the line except for "Msg:".  The body of the message starts on the line following "Msg:" and extends to the end of the template.  Note, you may omit the "Msg:" line if you don't want to specify a body. All commands are optional.  If a template command is omitted, the corresponding field on the message will be unaltered.

Type:Winlink | P2P | RO - Select Winlink, Peer-to-Peer, or Radio-only message transmission.
Ex: Type:Winlink   or   Type:P2P  or Type:RO

To:[Target addresses] - If present, populates the To field on the form.
Ex: To:user1@mymail.com; user2@mymail.com

CC:[Target CC addresses] - If present, populates the CC field.  The CC field is not available for Peer-to-Peer messages.
Ex: CC:otheruser@mymail.com

Subj:[The desired subject line] - If present, populates the subject field.
Ex: Subj:Daily status report from <Callsign>

Attach:file1, file2, ... - If present, specifies one or more files to attach to the message.

SeqSet: value - Sets the sequence number to the specified value.  Note: the normal way to set the sequence number is on the Template Settings page.
Ex: SeqSet: 0

SeqInc: [value] - Increments the sequence number by the specified value.  If the value is omitted, the sequence number is incremented by 1.  The increment may be negative. Note that SeqSet must be terminated by a colon even if no value is specified.
Ex: SeqInc: 1

Def: variable=value - Define a variable and assign a value to it.  The value may contain tag fields such as <ask> and <select>.  The value of a variable can be inserted into a message by using the <var variable> template insertion tag (see below).

	      Def: mycallsign=<ask Callsign:,UP>
	      Def: statecode=<select Alabama=AL,Georgia=GA,Tennessee=TN>

If options are specified, separate them from the prompt string with a comma, and use commas to separate multiple options.  Note, since comma is used to terminate the prompt string, you cannot used a comma within a prompt string.  You can spell out the full option keywords, but only the first two characters are significant.  If you want to use a comma in the prompt string, enclose the prompt with quote marks.

The following options may be used:
UPPERCASE - Force input for the field to be upper-case characters.  Typically this us used to accept Call signs.
MULTILINE - Accept a multi-line, free-form text field.  If this isn't specified, a single-line field is accepted.

Ex: <Ask Your callsign:,UP>
Ex: <Ask "Name, Position">
Ex: <Ask Time of incident (hh:mm UTC):>
Ex: Ask Description of incident:,MU>

Here's an example of a template using ask fields:

Type: Winlink
To: W4XXX
CC: 
Subj: //WL2K R/AFTER ACTION REPORT TN
Msg:

Callsign: <ask Your callsign:,UP>
Time: <ask Time (hh:mm UTC):>
Description:
<ask Description of event:,mu>

BT

NNNN

Note: These insertion tags also can be used in html forms displayed by Winlink Express.  When using insertion tags in a form, enclose the tag with "{" and "}" characters rather than "<" and ">". For example, {Callsign}.

Callsign-specific Templates, Global Templates and Standard Templates

Winlink Express supports three sets of templates: (1) callsign-specific templates that are associated with a specific callsign selected within Winlink Express; (2) Global templates that are available from any callsign; and (3) Standard templates that are created and supported by the Winlink Development Team.  If you wish to create or edit templates, you should put your templates in the callsign-specific group or the global group. Templates in the standard template group should not be modified.

Callsign-specific templates are stored in a folder named "Templates" under the folder with the callsign within the Winlink Express program folder.  For example, templates for W4PHS would be stored in C:\RMS Express\W4PHS\Templates.

Global Templates are stored in the "Templates" folder under the "Global Folders" folder in the RMS Express program folder.  For example, C:\RMS Express\Global Folders\Templates\

Standard Templates are in the "Standard Templates" folder.  For example, C:\RMS Express\Standard Templates\

Template files can be created with a text editor like Notepad and should be placed in the appropriate folder.  You also can use the Template Manager feature in Winlink Express you can access by clicking Message/Templates.

Here is a sample template file:

Type:Winlink
To:user1@mymail.net;user3@mymail.com
CC:user2@mymail.net
Subj:Test template on <UDateTime>
Msg:Display tags

DateTime     : <DateTime>
UTC DateTime : <UDateTime>
Date         : <Date>
UTC Date     : <UDate>
Time         : <Time>
UTC Time     : <UTime>
Day          : <Day>
UTC Day      : <UDay>
GPS Location : <GPS>
Position     : <Position>
Callsign     : <Callsign>


After applying this template, the message form would look like this:

{bmc MessageTemplate.bmp}


Template Manager

Winlink Express includes a Template Manager where you can view and edit existing templates and add or remove templates.  Start the Template Manager by clicking "Messages" on the main screen menu bar followed by "Templates..." from the menu drop-down list.

{bmc TemplateManager.png}

To edit an existing template, select (highlight) the name of the template and then click "Edit" or just double click the name of the template.

{bmc TemplateEditor.bmp}

Specifying Favorite Templates

Winlink Express allows you to set up to the "favorite" templates.  If a favorite template is set, its name will be displayed on the menu bar for the new-message entry screen.  To set favorite templates, click "Messages" on the main menu followed by "Set favorite templates".  This screen will be displayed:

{bmc SetFavoriteTemplates.png}

There are two items for each favorite template:

Display name -- This is the name that will be displayed on the new message menu bar.

File name -- This is the name of the actual template file.  You can click the Browse button to browse for a template file.

Here's a new message screen showing "Incident Report" as one of the favorite templates.

{bmc FavoriteTemplateExample.png}

Template Settings

To control various template settings, click "Messages" on the main menu bar followed by "Template Settings".  A screen similar to this will be displayed:

{bmc Template Settings.png}

Template Sequence Number

Winlink Express provides a sequence number that can be incremented and inserted in templates and forms by using the <SeqNum> template insertion tag.  Specify on this screen the initial sequence number and the number of digits you want in the inserted value.  Note: If you use the "SeqInc:" template command in your template, it will increment the sequence number before it is inserted.  So, if you want the first inserted sequence number to be 1, set the initial value on this screen to 0.

You also can specify the number of digits you want displayed when the sequence number is inserted.  If the formatted value is shorter than the specified size, it is padded with leading zeros to reach the specified number of digits.

Default Template

You can specify a default template that will be used for all messages.  This is useful for creating a signature block to be used for every message.  You can override the default template for a specific message by selecting the template you want to use while you are editing the message.

To set a default template, click "Message" on the main menu and select "Set Default Template" from the drop-down list.  This screen will be displayed:


Click "Select the default template" to select the default template.  Make sure "Enable the default template" is checked if you want to use the default.

For example, here is a sample signature block:

[start of template]
Msg:

Phil
W4PHS
[end of template]

This template begins with "Msg:" which signals that the following lines go in the body of the message.  A blank line is inserted followed by a name and callsign.  The "Msg:" line is not included in the message body, so each message will be initialized with a single blank line followed by the signature lines.
